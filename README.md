Python code to display 'Nike' symbol in Blue colour.  
SENSE HAT: The Sense HAT is an add-on board for Raspberry Pi, made especially for the Astro Pi mission. It has an 8Ã—8 RGB LED matrix, a five-button joystick and includes sensors like Gyroscope, Accelerometer, Humidity, Temperature, Magnetometer etc.
In a nutshell a HAT is a rectangular board (65x56mm) that has four mounting holes in the (nicely rounded) corners that align with the mounting holes on the B+, has a 40W GPIO header and supports the special autoconfiguration system that allows automatic GPIO setup and driver setup.  

In this program, I have displayed the famous brand "NIKE" symbol in Blue colour. The code and execution can be accessed in the link provided below:  
P.S. Give it a try and manipulate the code to get set with your favourite brand logo/your own designs in the colour you wish to see them in! :)
